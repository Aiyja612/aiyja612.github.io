        <h1> My name is Aiyjalon Foose-Campbell but I prefer to go by Aiyja.</h1>
            <p>I am from a military family. Both of my parents were in the Air Force so most of my childhood involved moving.</p>
            <p>Even though my dad bred dogs, I ended up raising three lovely feline companions (one who is considered special needs.)</p>
            <p>I plan on going on an Alaskan cruise for Christmas next year.</p>
